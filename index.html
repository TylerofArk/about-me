		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				I was raised outside of city limits, or as we called it “the country.” I grew up trying to catch
				crawdads in
				the creek, climbing trees and sitting around more campfires than I can count. I joined the Marine Corps
				in
				2009 as a combat correspondent and undertook 8 years of learning the trade of photography and
				videography
				while telling the story of our nations service members.

				The constant of those chapters of life is the outdoors. Although my military work taught me to focus on
				capturing action that tells a story, it was the beauty of the environments that really spoke to me. My
				childhood memories of growing up outside are my inspiration. Memories of being raised on 10 acres
				of land in the Ozarks, where we fished in the summer for some of our meals and spent nearly every day in
				the
				woods. Memories of riding up and down hilly red dirt roads on my bike, exploring what I thought was the
				whole world — memories of the summers on Beaver Lake, jumping off rocks and swimming in the
				cold clear water next to the dam. All my favorite memories of life have been outside. It’s with that
				passion
				that I take on every project and share the magic of the great outdoors and the fire it lights in the
				soul.
